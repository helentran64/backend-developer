## **What is the difference between web page, website, web server, and search engine?**

- Web page
    - A document which can be displayed in a web browser such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari. These are also often called just "pages.”
- Website
    - A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "website" or a "site.”
- Web server
    - A computer that hosts a website on the Internet.
- Search engine
    - A web service that helps you find other web pages, such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo. Search engines are normally accessed through a web browser (e.g. you can perform search engine searches directly in the address bar of Firefox, Chrome, etc.) or through a web page (e.g. bing.com or duckduckgo.com).
